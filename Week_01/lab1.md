## What fields did you use?
   I calculated the population density for Native Americans (aka NATIVE_DEN) by dividing NATIVE_AM by AREA_SQ_K. 
## Why did you use these fields?
  I used these fields because the Native American population is small and I wanted to see how the Native American population density differs in each county. For example, Los Angeles county has the largest Native American population density of 5.964 while Sierra County has a population density of 0.02. Depending on each county is there is large difference in the Native American population denisty.

## What problems could the data set have?
   Some problems that the data set could have are that it does not take into account every single person due to human error in the census and people could have been deliberately excluded in the census, so it is not representative of actual populations and it can have biases.
