    <p> My name is Rachel and I am a Sophomore at UCLA. I am new to web development and
        Geographic Information Science (GIS), but I am determined to learn the tools necessay
       to create applications that give voice to my community. As a I continue to learn about the 
       usage of these tools to help civil society, I am also learning about the ethics. Through understanding the 
       misuse and harm that these tools can have on communities, I am conscious about how I use 
       these tools and the ways in which I can use these tools for good. My goals as a critical 
       and digital map maker are to use open-source data, allow everyone to be included in my data 
       and data visualizations, and allow my local communities members to regain 
       their voices. Specifically, I hope to focus on understanding where hate crimes are concentrated 
       and how hate crimes have made community members, such as Asian American elderly, 
       fearful of leaving their homes to run errands.
