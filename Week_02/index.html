            <h4> Hello, my name is Rachel! This website will be a compilation of all 
                the maps that I will be making. I am new to GIS, web develepment, and 
                digital map making, but I am excited to learn how to create maps that use open-source data 
                to help my community. For more information, click the About page and you 
                will find my biography, an explanation of my goals as a critical and 
                digital map maker, and my avatar. Click to the Maps page to see an extra map, which has all  
                the places that I want to travel to once the COVID-19 Pandemic is over. The first map that I created 
                is the map below, which has some of the National Parks that I have visited throughout the past few years.
                I hope you enjoy!
