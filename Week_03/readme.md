- A [loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/loop) that uses the JavaScript array and adds the items to the map
- A [JavaScript function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) that interacts with your map
- A button [`<button>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) that executes  the JavaScript function to interact with your map
